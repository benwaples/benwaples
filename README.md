## Hey, I'm Ben (he/him)!

<!-- Description -->
I am a Full Stack JavaScript developer with experience in team development and leadership. I am driven to deliver high quality work with all things I do! I have 2 experience years with managing client relationships, creating and delivering high quality products, and exceeding goals/ expectations. 

I am certain that diversity of thought is the only way the world will get better, I am passionate about the health of our planet, and I'm still not over the fact that people have experienced outer space... WHAT?!

I am a rower, photographer, vegan cook, recreational wood worker, and coffee enthusiast.
